# Class Projects in Machine Learning

Welcome to my repository for the Machine Learning class projects. Here you'll find a collection showcasing my works throughout my participation at CS114.O21.KHCL, most of which is work-in-progress due to having too much exercises to do.

## Projects

### 1. IT001 Score Prediction
In this project, we aimed to predict GPA, process and hands on scores for IT001 class participant based on submission data from Wecode. The dataset includes anonymized student data and submission details. The goal was to use this data to predict the scores effectively, and the competition was evaluated based on the R² score. In this project i have implemented the basic concept, but the score was pretty low since i haven't clean data and applying better features yet.

### 2. Hand Written Digit Classification
This project focused on classifying handwritten digits using various machine learning algorithms. We explored different models and techniques to improve the accuracy of digit recognition on the MNIST dataset. Our group made a custom dataset, resize it to 225x225 and convert the data to grayscale so this test data could fit with a pretrained model

### 3. Final Project: Motorcycle Classification
The final project involved classifying motorcycle images into categories such as Honda, Suzuki, VinFast, Yamaha, and Others. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and various data augmentation techniques were applied to improve model performance. I contributed 494 data, most of them (~98%) are crawled and cleaned, after this i performed feature extraction using vgg16 without top layer (classification) but the notebook crashed halfway through.

Thank you for visiting my repository, i have made lots of mistakes during the time in this course, but i always try my best.
